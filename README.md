# Marauder Map Application

Marauder Map is an interactive map application inspired by the magical map from the Harry Potter series. Our application is designed to provide users with real-time traffic data and efficient route planning using A* and Dijkstra algorithms. By leveraging the Overpass API, Marauder Map delivers accurate traffic information for optimized navigation experiences.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Data:** Fetches real-time traffic data from Overpass API to provide up-to-date informations.
- **Route Optimization:** Utilizes A* and Dijkstra algorithms to find the shortest and quietest (less traffic) routes.
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless navigation and interaction.
- **Customizable:** Allows users to input start and end locations for personalized route planning.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Offers route options that may outperform other mapping applications like Google Maps in certain scenarios.
