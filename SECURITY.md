## Reporting a Vulnerability

At ImageProfiler, we take security seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, we encourage you to responsibly disclose them to us.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Email:** Send an email to [arunim.malviya.13@gmail.com](mailto:arunim.malviya.13@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. **Subject:** Use a clear and descriptive subject line (e.g., "Security Vulnerability - Maradour's Map").
3. **Provide Details:** Include thorough information about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and strive to provide regular updates as we address the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to investigate and address it. We appreciate your cooperation in keeping our users and systems safe.

## Updates and Patching

Once a security vulnerability is verified, we will work diligently to develop and release patches. Updates will be provided on the GitHub repository and included in release notes.

Your efforts in contributing to the security of ImageProfiler are highly valued, and we appreciate your commitment to responsible disclosure.

Thank you for helping us make ImageProfiler a secure and reliable tool.
